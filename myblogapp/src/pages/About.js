  <li class="list-group-item">During their mission in Yorknew City, the group consisted of thirteen members, but it currently has only ten. Each member has a numbered tattoo of a twelve-legged spider on their body. Those wishing to join the group can do so by killing a current member, thereby replacing them. The group’s leader fills other vacancies, and members can offer nominations.

Although they occasionally do philanthropic work, the Troupe mainly steals and kills. After the leader revels in the group’s spoils, he sells everything.Among their crimes is the massacre of the Kurta Clan and the stealing of their Scarlet Eyes. They are also a major asset in the defense of Meteor City, as shown when they defeated Zazan and her group of Chimera Ants. However, they were responsible for ruining the ideal partnership with the Mafia and are considered outliers even by the city’s standards.

Despite their close ties to one another, they will allow those who have killed their members to join. While Chrollo organized a massacre against the Mafia as revenge for one of their deceased members, Machi speculated that he might ask the killer to join the group.</li>

  <li class="list-group-item">Around fifteen years before the beginning of the series, prior to the creation of the Phantom Troupe under its common name, it was a group of children from Meteor City, a junkyard city that is inhabited by outcasts; doing live voiceovers for movies found in landfills. The group was formed after Chrollo, along with Pakunoda, Sheila and Sarasa, first staged Power Cleaners. This encouraged Uvogin, Feitan, Phinks, Nobunaga, Shalnark, and Franklin to join. Machi was also with them, but for some time she did not want to agree to the roles offered to her. With such a composition of people, the name "Troupe" was chosen, but there was still no idea for its second part.

One day, Sarasa didn't show up at the show. The troupe learned that she had not been seen since yesterday. Most of the children watching the Troupe's shows decided to help in the search. Chrollo paired up with Uvogin, and after a long time of searching, they came up with the idea of checking out the Uga Forest. They gathered the other members and they all went into the forest together. There they found the scene of the crime, the instruments of torture, a note left behind and a sack hanging from a tree. Chrollo was the only one who could read the contents of the note, but he chose not to share it with others. When Uvogin took the sack from the tree, Chrollo decided to check the contents. It turned out that Sarasa's destroyed body was inside. Some time later, Troupe attends Sarasa's funeral, after which Chrollo talks to Uvogin about their group's future. He asks him to wait three years, in which he will be able to get the necessary funds to carry out his plan, which consists in creating a website that lures criminals to Meteor City, so that they may find Sarasa's killers amongst them and then they will exact vengeance on the culprits. During the conversation, they are joined by the other members of the Troupe, except for Sheila, who decides to leave the group. Each of the other members chooses Chrollo as the leader of the group, which will be formed in three years.</li>

  <img src={Rules}  alt="..."/>
  </li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Mirroring the metaphorical representation of the group as a twelve-legged spider, the Phantom Troupe is ideally composed of thirteen members in total, one "head" and twelve "legs". All the "legs" are equal in ranking and decision-making power, and tasks are assigned based on each member's individual skills or preferences. The "head" is the leader, whose orders are to be of the utmost priority; however, their life is not, since even the leader can be replaced. The members are expected to always adhere to the governing principle that the prosperity of the group as a whole trumps the survival of any one of its individuals, including the leader himself. In Chrollo's case, however, several members had become so reliant on him that they prioritized his life over the group’s survival.

The Troupe does not assemble frequently but gathers at the leader’s request, which can be discretionary or mandatory. Skipping a mandatory meeting could result in a member being punished. Only the leader has the authority to add new members, although they can recommend candidates they deem suitable. Defeating a current member is a viable way to replace them, which may not be subject to the leader’s approval.

Other than following their leader’s orders and not fighting amongst themselves, members are not expected to follow any specific procedures. Although some members believe buying and bidding to be against the ways of the group, others have no qualms about resorting to legal, non-violent channels and transactions, with at least two of them becoming Hunters for the associated benefits. It has been noted that two members are always by the leader’s side when the Troupe gathers together, but it is unknown whether this is an official rule.

</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Members of the Phantom Troupe, with the possible exception of Chrollo, sport a tattoo of a twelve-legged spider somewhere on their body. Inside the spider, there is a number ranging from 1 to 12, which differs for each member. The only members whose tattoos have been seen are Shizuku and the deceased Uvogin. It is unknown how these numbers are assigned. Although the twelve-legged spider is instantly recognizable as the symbol of the Troupe, the fact that it’s numbered is not as widely known.</li>
