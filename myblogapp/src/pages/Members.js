        <li class="list-group-item">Name: Chrollo Lucilfer</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Info: Chrollo is calm, intelligent, and charismatic, as he seems to be a born leader and able to hold the Troupe together despite the volatile personalities of its members. While he is a very capable strategist, Chrollo is also very confident in his own fighting abilities as well as in those of the other members of the Spider. He always has at least two people with him, which is why Hisoka found it so difficult to fight him. After he has admired the items that he targeted and acquired, Chrollo sells them all. It is also stated that Chrollo likes antique books.</li>

        <li class="list-group-item">Info: Nobunaga is typically a calm individual, but can be brash and get into conflicts with the other Troupe members. While he demonstrates good fighting speed and capacity for reason, he does seem to struggle with impromptu decision-making. This is first seen when Owl traps the car the Troupe members were riding in; every occupant of the car was able to escape except for Nobunaga. However, this was mostly due to the fact that he was sitting in the middle back seat and had the worst position. Furthermore, when Gon and Killua announce their plan to attack him together, Nobunaga activates his En and prepares himself for the attack instead of pursuing either of the boys, ultimately giving them the chance to escape.</li>

        <li class="list-group-item">Name: Feitan Portor</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Info: Very proficient in the art of torture, Feitan is the Phantom Troupe's interrogator. His speech usually consists of few words and poor grammar; when angered, he speaks a language of unknown origin, different from the common language of the world.

Although he is very loyal to Chrollo, Feitan prioritizes the survival of the Troupe itself. He is implied to be deeply involved with all Troupe activities, remembering exactly how long it had been since all the group’s members had gathered together, what had changed since then, and who the new members were.</li>

        <li class="list-group-item">Name: Machi Komacine</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Info: Machi is one of the coldest members of Troupe, almost never losing her cool or displaying any emotions. However, according to Shalnark, she is a good person at heart. She has been shown to care for Pakunoda, as she was one of the members who mourned her death and watched over her grave. Furthermore, Machi is fiercely loyal to Chrollo, going so far as to challenge two other Troupe members for his sake. She also stated that she would hunt down Hisoka if he were to kill Chrollo. She is very confident in her strength and replies accordingly if threatened.</li>

        <li class="list-group-item">Info: Kalluto has a silent and obedient personality, often seen doing what he is told. He is established to have a very good relationship with his mother. While he is very quiet, he has shown to be more talkative after joining the Spiders. He is also shown to be quite calm with good control of his feelings. Nonetheless, he proves during his fight against a Chimera Ant that, despite his calm demeanor, Kalluto has a brutal side and a bad habit of dragging out a fight in order to toy with his victims.</li>

        <li class="list-group-item">Info: Phinks is short-tempered and rather ruthless. He can be brash and has a tendency to get into conflicts with other people, including his comrades. Phinks seems to get along with Feitan the most and is often seen partnering with him, both in and out of combat. He is very loyal to Chrollo, as shown when he was the first to try to go after Kurapika after Chrollo was captured, despite the objections of other members.</li>

        <li class="list-group-item">Name: Franklin Bordeau</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Info: Complementing his appearance, Franklin never hesitates to kill, even reveling in combat. He is quick-tempered when challenged, to the point of engaging in a fight with a fellow Troupe member. He often teams up with Shizuku. He is also extremely analytical in difficult situations, capable of resolving disagreements among Troupe members. When Phinks, Feitan, Machi, and Pakunoda argue about whether or not to pursue the chain user, Franklin stresses the importance of the Troupe’s survival. His loyalty to the Troupe is unquestionable, as he is willing to kill some members and start over if necessary.</li>

        <li class="list-group-item">Info: Shizuku is very calm. She did not emote even when announcing that according to her fortune, she would die the following week. She is characterized as aloof, callous, and soulless. Her blunt, cold statements frequently offend those around her and create resentment. She is forgetful to the point of short-term memory loss; sometimes she forgets people's names or that she has ever met them at all. She can be air-headed, which often causes opponents to underestimate her combat abilities. Shizuku believes in the Troupe's rules set forth by Chrollo and is strongly against members fighting one another.</li>

        <li class="list-group-item">Info: Very little is known about Bonolenov's personality and his reasons for joining the Troupe. However, during his brief fight against a Chimera Ant, Bonolenov presents himself as a graceful warrior. He speaks in a formal and regal manner and displays pride regarding his tribe. Unlike the other Troupe members, Bonolenov doesn't revel in fighting and killing, only doing so when provoked. At such times, he calmly displays both power and confidence.</li>

        <li class="list-group-item">Info: Illumi, for the most part, displays very little expression. In contrast to his expressionless demeanor, Illumi often speaks in a somewhat joyful and absent-minded tone. He is generally a stony, ruthless person with an extremely cold way of thinking and reflects solely on his own interests. Still, he holds a twisted and overprotective form of love for his younger brother, Killua; this manifests to the point that he used his Nen ability to control Killua in order to ensure his survival and obedience. He and his father raised Killua to believe that the only thing sustaining him was darkness and that he could only obtain joy in causing the death of others. As a means of protecting his little brother, Illumi implanted a needle in Killua's brain, forcing the latter to run from battles he wasn't sure he could win.</li>

        <li class="list-group-item">Info: Pakunoda exuded an air of self-confidence that could be intimidating to others. She was completely loyal to Chrollo. She even went against the Troupe and Chrollo's own, saying that the survival of the group comes before the survival of the individual (including the leader) in order to rescue him. Pakunoda was very loyal to the Spider as well, sacrificing herself so that her comrades could know about Kurapika's abilities. Like the other members of the Troupe, she did not care at all about those who do not belong to the group. Two notable exceptions were Gon and Killua. She was impressed by their refusal to escape so that the deal between the Troupe and Kurapika could be made with no further bloodshed.</li>

        <li class="list-group-item">Info: Uvogin was a typical Enhancer: determined, headstrong, simple, and sometimes disrespectful. He was barbaric in manner, viewing even pain as merely a nuisance. Like all members of the Phantom Troupe, Uvogin never hesitated to kill and was remorseless in doing so. He also enjoyed killing people who wanted revenge. He was only interested in physical training and fighting.He particularly enjoyed fights against skilled opponents, but he would typically rush into battle without a plan. However, despite often rushing into battle and fighting in a barbaric manner, he was extremely resourceful, able to defeat three skilled Nen users (Porcupine, Rabid Dog, and Leech) using only his head, after being paralyzed from the neck down. Although he prefered to fight alone, Uvogin became stronger when fighting with a partner, because he fought better when he had someone to protect. Uvogin was best friends with Nobunaga, and the two brought out the best in each other during combat. Like the other members of the Troupe, Uvogin was absolutely loyal to Chrollo and the Spiders' ideals. He disliked carrying money and claimed that he had no use for it, firmly believing that one should steal whatever they desire. He would only remember people he killed if they made a lasting impression. He was also very punctual and often argued with Nobunaga and Franklin about their tardiness.</li>
